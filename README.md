# Traffic_Management_System_Random_Forest_Regressor
Traffic congestion has become a significant problem in the majority of cities, mainly due to factors such as rapid urban population growth, inadequate transportation infrastructure, poor traffic management, and a lack of real-time traffic data. These challenges make it difficult for city planners and traffic management authorities to manage traffic flow effectively, resulting in increased travel times, fuel consumption, decreased productivity, and worsening traffic congestion. This project aims to predict the number of cars at a given time to help drivers decide whether to use alternative roads or not.
